# Class-2-Assignment
My Name is Sargun Singh. I am an Finance Generalist with AML Specialisation. I am working in the Banking Industry and aim to create AML Solutions for end customers to be able to transact and transact with increased transparency and integrity at reduced costs. I choose FinTech as a career path as I have background in Regulatory environment that I think I can use in the RegTech domain. 

Thank you
